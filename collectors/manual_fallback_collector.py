        The thing about production is that it's not about adding more. It's about finding 
        what's already there and revealing it. When I worked with Johnny Cash on the American 
        Recordings, we stripped everything away. Just him and his guitar. That's when you 
        could really hear the soul of the song.
        
        I think the role of a producer is to be a mirror for the artist. To help them see 
        what they might not see themselves. Sometimes that means saying less. Sometimes it 
        means creating a space where they feel safe to be vulnerable.
        
        The best albums often come from a place of not knowing. When you think you know 
        exactly what you're doing, that's when you're in trouble. The magic happens in the 
        uncertainty, in the exploration. That's where the real discoveries are made.
        
        With the Red Hot Chili Peppers on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, we went to this mansion 
        and just lived there. We weren't making a record, we were living a life that 
        happened to include making music. That's a very different energy than going to a 
        studio from 2 to 6.
        
        I don't believe in the idea of fixing things in the mix. If it doesn't feel right 
        when you're recording it, it's not going to feel right later. The emotion has to 
        be there in the moment. You can't manufacture that afterwards.

# Manual Transcript Collection Instructions

Since automated collection is currently failing, here are methods for manual collection:

## Method 1: YouTube Transcript Copy
1. Go to the YouTube video
2. Click the "..." menu below the video
3. Select "Show transcript"
4. Click the three dots in the transcript window
5. Toggle off timestamps
6. Select all text and copy

## Method 2: Browser Extensions
- "YouTube Transcript Extractor" Chrome extension
- "Transcripts for YouTube" Firefox addon

## Method 3: Alternative Services
- downsub.com (paste YouTube URL)
- youtubetranscript.com
- Rev.com (paid service, high quality)

## High Priority Videos to Collect:
"""
        
        for content in sorted(self.high_priority_content, key=lambda x: x['priority'], reverse=True):
            instructions += f"\n### {content['title']}"
            instructions += f"\n- URL: https://youtube.com/watch?v={content['video_id']}"
            instructions += f"\n- Channel: {content['channel']}"
            instructions += f"\n- Priority: {content['priority']}/10"
            instructions += f"\n- Description: {content['description']}\n"
        
        instructions += """
## Storage Format
Save transcripts as text files named: `{video_id}_transcript.txt`
Place in: `data/manual_transcripts/`

## Quality Guidelines
- Prefer videos where Rick Rubin is the main speaker
- Look for discussions about production philosophy
- Prioritize recent content (Tetragrammaton podcast)
- Include conversations about specific albums/artists
