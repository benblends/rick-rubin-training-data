- Provide a comprehensive analysis of each source, including access methods, licensing considerations, quality assessment, and relevance for LLM training.
- Deliver a final research analysis report that categorizes sources and provides actionable data extraction strategies.

## Research Breakdown
- **Phase 1: Foundational Research & Source Identification**
  - Sub-task 1.1: Identify and list Rick Rubin's published books and major written interviews.
  - Sub-task 1.2: Locate and list all non-YouTube audio interviews, podcasts, and radio appearances.

  - Sub-task 1.4: Search for academic papers, case studies, and industry publications that analyze Rick Rubin's work.
  - Sub-task 1.5: Gather information from industry databases like AllMusic, Discogs, and MusicBrainz for production credits and liner notes.
- **Phase 2: Content Extraction & Analysis**
  - Sub-task 2.1: Develop and execute a plan to extract content from the identified sources.
  - Sub-task 2.2: Analyze the extracted content for quality, relevance, and suitability for LLM training.
  - Sub-task 2.3: Research and document the copyright and licensing status of each source.
- **Phase 3: Synthesis & Reporting**
  - Sub-task 3.1: Categorize the sources by type, accessibility, and training value.
  - Sub-task 3.2: Synthesize the findings into a comprehensive research analysis report.
  - Sub-task 3.3: Propose a technical implementation approach for data extraction and processing.

## Key Questions
1. What are the most authoritative and in-depth sources of Rick Rubin's creative philosophy outside of his book "The Creative Act"?
2. What are the best non-YouTube audio sources that capture his conversational and coaching style?
3. What are the legal and ethical considerations for using these materials to train a commercial AI model?
4. What are the most effective methods for extracting usable text data from diverse formats (e.g., audio, print)?
5. What lesser-known or archival sources might provide unique insights into his long career?

## Resource Strategy
- **Primary Data Sources**:
  - Web search for books, articles, interviews, podcasts.
  - Academic search engines (e.g., Google Scholar) for scholarly articles.
  - Music industry databases (e.g., AllMusic, Discogs).
- **Search Strategies**:
  - "Rick Rubin interview" -youtube
  - "Rick Rubin podcast" -youtube
  - "Rick Rubin The Creative Act"
  - "Rick Rubin production techniques"
  - "Rick Rubin in conversation"
  - "filetype:pdf Rick Rubin"
  - "Rick Rubin" site:*.edu OR site:*.ac.*

## Verification Plan
- **Source Requirements**: Minimum of 50 sources. Prioritize primary sources (interviews, writings by Rubin) and reputable secondary sources (major publications, academic articles).
- **Cross-validation**: Verify information about interviews and publications across multiple sources to confirm dates, publishers, and content.

## Expected Deliverables
- A final research analysis report in Markdown format.
- A CSV or markdown table of the 50+ sources with detailed metadata.
- A document outlining data extraction strategies.

## Workflow Selection
- **Primary focus**: Search
- **Justification**: The core of the task is to find and document a large number of sources. The verification is part of the analysis of each source, but the primary activity is searching for information.
