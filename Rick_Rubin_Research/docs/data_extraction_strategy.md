# Data Extraction Strategy for Rick Rubin LLM Training Data

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the strategy for extracting data from the identified sources to be used for training the Rick Rubin LLM. The goal is to extract high-quality text data that captures Rick Rubin's voice, philosophy, and creative process.

## 2. Source Types and Extraction Methods

### 2.1. Books

- **Source:** "The Creative Act: A Way of Being" (PDF and text format)
- **Extraction Method:** The full text has already been extracted from the PDF into a plain text file (`data/the_creative_act_full_content.txt`). No further extraction is needed. The text can be directly used for training.

### 2.2. Articles & Interviews (Text-Based)

- **Sources:** Various online articles and interviews.
- **Extraction Method:** Use a web scraping tool to extract the main text content from the URLs. For each URL in `data/rick_rubin_source_analysis.csv` identified as "Article" or "Interview", a script will be developed to fetch the HTML content and parse it to extract the relevant text, stripping out HTML tags, ads, and other non-content elements.

### 2.3. Podcasts

- **Sources:** Tetragrammaton, Broken Record, etc.
- **Extraction Method:** For podcasts with available transcripts, the transcripts can be directly downloaded or scraped. For those without transcripts, an automated speech-to-text (ASR) service will be used to transcribe the audio. The resulting text will be cleaned and formatted.

### 2.4. Academic/Scholarly Articles

- **Sources:** Articles from `.edu` and `.ac.` domains, and PDF articles.
- **Extraction Method:** For PDF articles, the text will be extracted using a PDF-to-text conversion tool. For web-based articles, the same web scraping method as for other articles will be used.

### 2.5. Databases/Credits

- **Sources:** AllMusic, Wikipedia, Rate Your Music.
- **Extraction Method:** The production credits and discography information from these sites can be scraped. This data will be used to create a structured dataset of his work, which can be used to augment the training data with factual information about his projects.

## 3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Once the raw data is extracted, it will be cleaned and preprocessed to make it suitable for LLM training. This will involve:

- **Removing boilerplate content:** Headers, footers, navigation bars, etc.
- **Normalizing text:** Converting to a consistent case, removing special characters, etc.
- **Structuring the data:** Formatting the data into a consistent format (e.g., JSON or CSV) with metadata such as the source, date, and type.

## 4. Licensing and Copyright

All extracted data will be used in accordance with the licensing terms of the original sources. For copyrighted material, the use will be limited to research and educational purposes. No commercial use of the data will be made without obtaining the necessary licenses.
